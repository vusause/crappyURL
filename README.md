An [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/) clone I work on my spare time.
A working build is available at http://34.69.165.82:8080/ and is pending an domain and SSL Cert

### Getting Started
Please have [Docker]() and [NodeJS]() installed. Then run the following commands:
```

```
You can then access the app on [localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999/);

### Todo
- Include a Postgres k8s manifest
